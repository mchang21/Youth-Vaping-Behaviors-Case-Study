# Youth Vaping Behaviors Case Study

This is a group project for COGS 137 - Practical Data Science in R

## Introduction

In this case study, we seek to analyze tobacco and e-cigarette trends and usage among middle school and high school students (grades 6-12) in the United States. It is without question that the use of tobacco is directly correlated with diseases which may lead to death. It has been known that tobacco is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States (Slide 5, CS03 (Data)). Seeing as how tobacco product usage begins early--during youth and young adulthood--we want to exactly see notable trends in order to minimize tobacco usage in young adults. However, despite declines in tobacco usage, the rise of e-cigarette usage has caused an increase in tobacco product usage among middle school and high school students (Slide 5, CS03 (Data)). Despite not being actual cigarettes, these young adults should still be wary of the health effects associated with e-cigarettes. This includes volatile organic compounds, cancer-causing chemicals, nicotine, ultrafine particles, heavy metals, and flavoring chemicals which are linked to serious lung disease (Slide 6, CS03 (Data)). E-cigarettes are still capable of causing serious lung damage and injury. Analyzing what trends exist for tobacco and e-cigarette usage among middle school and high school students may help to prevent the rising trend of e-cigarette usage and further prevent deadly diseases and lung damage.

## Task

Analyze trends in tobacco and e-cigarette usage among U.S. middle and high school students (grades 6â€“12) to better understand youth consumption patterns and inform prevention efforts targeting early nicotine exposure and related health risks.

## Questions

1. How has tobacco and e-cigarette/vaping use by American youths changed since 2015?    
2. How does e-cigarette use compare between males and females?    
3. What vaping brands and flavors appear to be used the most frequently?       
4. Is there a relationship between e-cigarette/vaping use and other tobacco use?     
5. How does class level in school change the answer to the above questions?

## Data Set

The data we will be using for this case study comes from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS). The data is an annual survey which asks middle school and high school (grades 6-12) about their tobacco usage in the United States. The data we will be using is from 2015 to 2019.
